# LJ Code 201

## Day 1 - Nov 29, 2016

Today was more of an admin day, so there wasn't a lot of things we touched on. (code related)

For todays lab, I think I went a little overboard. But it's to be expected, because I get antsy when things are too simple. I either don't understand that it <em>could</em> be that simple or I make things harder for me in order to keep me busy. I also noticed that as usual I kept to myself. Although I did help some people out, which felt good.
