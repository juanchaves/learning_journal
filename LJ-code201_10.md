#Code 201 day 10

## Dec 11, 2016

This las week has been rough, it was a wake-up call. We have done so much in such little time. I still can't believe that I am actually doing the things I am doing. Over the last few days we focused a bit more on HTML & CSS. We talked about how HTML is used more for structure (the bones) and because it is that HTML should be the starting point of a project. It should be written down all the way until the structure is complete before starting with CSS (the "skin") and Js (the "muscles & organs"). After the HTML is written then one should move on to CSS and Js. Nevertheless, there are some functionalities that are innate in HTML5, like user-side validation.
