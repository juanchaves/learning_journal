# LJ Code 201

## Day 1 - Nov 30, 2016

Today we talked about a lot of things but the ones I wrote down were the following:

 Key -value pair in attributes: We spoke about how in HTML they reside in the <element key = "value">, in CSS they are the properties (i.e: p { key:value }, and in Js they live inside Objects { key:value };

That helps track them across the languages for better control over them "cross-platform".

Another thing we spoke about was Control-Flow: How to draw them using control points (rectangles) and decision points (diamonds). This ties in with writing out the logical framing of the code to make it easier to execute later.
